# Pancake-Flipping-with-Two-Spatulas
Program that creates a random shuffled array using the Fisher-yates algorithm and uses 3-approximation algorithm, 2-approximation algorithm, or the Forward March Algorithm to sort the array using grey and black edges. Details on algorithm can be found in original article: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3933.pdf
